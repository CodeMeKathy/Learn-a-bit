<!--! Feedback Notes -->
<!--Add naming convention i.e. classes not element tags  -->
<!-- Declaration Order in CSS -->
<!-- Ex. Margin Bottom is taking 8% from its parent element and it is always changing based on the user's viewpoint and leads to messiness. Not truly helping responsivity. So stick to `rem` and `em` in cases you know the font size of the parent, rather than vw, vh and %. Most browser default is 16px so using em you have to calc rem. for accurate use.

Remember -> Flexbox and rem are the main tools you need.
-> use div when their is no preexisting sematic component already
